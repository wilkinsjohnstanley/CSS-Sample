   <p>Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep,
    but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of
    sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed
    unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so
    much as quiver when a car door slammed in the next street,
    nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
    midnight before the cat moved at all.
     A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching,
    appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d
    just popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its
    eyes narrowed.
     Nothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive. </p>
     <img src="Images/chapter1.jpg">
     <p>He was tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair
        and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.
        He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the
        ground and high- heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were
        light, bright and sparkling behind half- moon spectacles and
        his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
        broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
         Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realise that he had just
        arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots
        was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking
        for something. But he did seem to realise he was being
        watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was
        still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some
        reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled
        and muttered, ‘I should have known.’ </p>
        <img src="Images/privetdrive.gif">
        <p>He had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket.
            It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He fl icked it open,
            held it up in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp
            went out with a little pop. He clicked it again – the next lamp
            fl ickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,
            until the only lights left in the whole street were two tiny
            pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
            watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now,
            even beady- eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see
            anything that was happening down on the pavement.
            Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and
            set off down the street towards number four, where he sat
            down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after
            a moment he spoke to it.
             ‘Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.’</p></div>
